Editor
======

Editor is a project that aims to explore and implement cutting edge text
editing technologies, eventually creating a text editor that - in the opinion
of its authors - surpasses other, currently existing text editors and IDEs.

The goal of this project is to create a text editing experience that is close
to that of editors such as vim or emacs when it comes to text manipulation,
while providing the functionality of IDEs by letting the editor have a deep
understanding of the text formats edited without the (cognitive) overhead they
impose on the user making them unsuitable for small tasks or users unfamiliar
with the languages they are working with.

As of now Editor is very much in a research state, meaning that the fundamental
architecture and involved technologies are still in question.
