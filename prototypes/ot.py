    This is a prototype for an implementation of context-based operational
    transformation as described in [1]_. The goal behind this prototype is to
    gain understanding on operational transformation with a focus on it's
    applicability on real-time collaborative text editing.

    Researching OT I've found that there are two main approaches in
    representing operations. The first one is to represent operations as
    actions such as ``Insert(position, string)`` and send those around, the
    second is two represent operations as patches ``[0-position,string,-end]``.

    At the moment I'm going with the first approach as this seems to be the one
    favored by [1]_ and performing IT is fairly straightforward. However there
    are several downsides. First of all overlapping concurrent delete and
    insert operations cannot be inclusion transformed without creating two
    operations, representing a single operation executed by the user. This
    requires some mapping between user and OT operations. The second issue is
    that patches allow for natural representation of more complex user
    operations such as substitutions, representing them as actions is trivial
    as well but it would make undo more complicated and I worry about possible
    side-effects with concurrency if such complex operations have to be
    splitted.
